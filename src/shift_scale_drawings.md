## Creating drawings that you can scale and shift

The code below creates an image of a house that fills a 
[0, 1] x [0, 1] square. The canvas itself is set to a scale of [0, 5] x [0, 5], so the house appears in the lower left corner. Examine the code carefully, since we will modify it to show how to shift and scale each shape in the drawing.

# Shifting (translating) images

Recall from algebra that to translate a point in the Cartesian plane to the right or left, we add or subtract from the `x` value, and to translate a point up or down, we add or subtract from the `y` value. We can use this idea to shift our house by modifying all of the `(x, y)` values. Below is the original program, modified so that the image is shifted 2 units to the right and 3 units up. All `x` values have been replaced by `2+x` and all `y` values have been replaced by `3+y`. Notice that only the numbers representing positions have been changed - no values representing sizes have been modified. The image on the right is still 1x1 in size, and still lies in a `[0, 5] x [0, 5]` canvas, but its lower left corner has been translated.

The above code would be much more flexible if we modified the `draw_house()` function to accept two parameters that give the `x`-shift and `y`-shift of the image. That way we could easily draw several houses, shifted to various locations with very small changes to the code. This strategy is demonstrated below, with multiple houses drawn at various locations. The changes made include
- In the `draw_house()` function, change the shift from `(2, 3)` to generic values of `(x_shift, y_shift)`
- Make the `draw_house()` function accept two parameters `x_shift` and `y_shift` for the generic shift values. These values are both specified to be `float` values.
- In the `main()` function, add several calls to `draw_house(_, _)`, with a variety of values for the shift.

## Scaling (stretching or compressing) images

This time we will modify the original code so that the image is scaled. If the scale factor is more than 1, then the image is stretched, while a scale factor of less than 1 results in a compression. Recall that to stretch/compress an `x` value, we multiply it by the scale factor. Geometrically, this results in every point being stretched away from the `y`-axis. Similarly, to stretch/compress a `y`-value, we multiply it by our other chosen scale factor, which stretches the point away from the `x`-axis. We can use this idea to change the size of our house. Below is the original program, modified so that the image is stretched a factor of 4 in the `x` direction and a factor of `2` in the `y`-direction. All of `x` values have been replaced by `4*x` and all `y` values have been replaced by `2*y`. Notice that numbers representing sizes (height and width) also must be scaled. The image on the right is now 4x2 in size, and its lower left corner still lies at the origin.

It shouldn't surprise you that our next step will be to modify the `draw_house()` function to accept two parameters for the `x`-scaling factor and the `y`-scaling factor. This makes our function flexible, so that the caller can determine the scaled size. As before, the changes made include
- In the `draw_house()` function, change the scaling from `4` in the `x` direction and `2` in the `y` direction to generic values of  `x_scale` and `y_scale`.
- Make the `draw_house()` function accept two parameters `x_scale` and `y_scale` for the generic scaling values. These values are both specified to be `float` values.
- In the `main()` function, add a call to `draw_house(_, _)`, with a chosen values for the size.

## Putting it all together

In the final example, we modify the code for `draw_house()` to allow for both shift values and scale values to set by the caller. This means our function will have four parameters:
- `x_shift`
- `y_shift`
- `x_scale`
- `y_scale`

Summary of changes made to each value in an image:
- Every original `xpos` position will be replaced by `x_shift + x_scale*xpos`
- Every original `ypos` position will be replaced by `y_shift + y_scale*ypos`
- Every original `x_size` size will be replaced by `x_scale*x_size`
- Every original `y_size` size will be replaced by `y_scale*y_size`

Notice that positions are scaled and shifted. Sizes, however, are just scaled and not shifted.
