## Control flow - iteration

This chapter concerns control flow with iterative structures, also known as loops. This allows you to write programs that execute tasks repeatedly. You'll learn about `for`-loops, `while`-loops, and nesting control structures with loops. This means nesting conditional statements within loops, nesting loops within conditional statements, or nesting loops within loops.

You'll also learn to apply and practice these ideas by creating animations using `dudraw`.
