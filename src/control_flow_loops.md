## Control flow - iteration

This chapter concerns control flow with iterative structures, also known as loops. This allows you to write programs that execute tasks repeatedly. You'll learn about `for`-loops, `while`-loops, and nesting control structures with loops. This means nesting conditional statements within loops, nesting loops within conditional statements, or nesting loops within loops.

An application you will use to practice this idea is to create animations using `dudraw`.
