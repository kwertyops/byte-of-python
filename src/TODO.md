These topics are missing from the book:

- traversing lists
- mouse press
- the term docstring
- shorthand ops
- Explain expressions well
- assert (it's in the videos and some labs/hw, but not in the text)
- algorithmic thinking (this is a day of class, and a preclass assignment, but no book section)
- More on formatting f-strings (not sure how well I explained .5f?)
