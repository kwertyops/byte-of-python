## Python lists
Lists are a built-in data structure in python. Lists are used to store multiple values that are accessed with a single variable name. 

Typically the values stored in a list are all of the same type, though python does allow for different types to be stored within the same list. This chapter contains details on creating lists, accessing individual elements in a list, and modifying lists with list methods.
