## Generating random numbers

Often when programming we would like to use random numbers. For example, if we want to put a circle on a `dudraw` canvas at a random location, then for the `(x, y)` location we would use two random numbers of type `float`, chosen between `0` and `1`. Or perhaps we want to write a program to play a guessing game where the user has to guess a number from `1` to `100`, so we would need to generate an integer in that range.

Note that on a computer, there is no such thing as a true random number, since the processes on a computer are deterministic. However, randomness can be simulated using complex mathematical functions. Numbers generated this way are called *pseudorandom numbers*.

## Generating random `float` values

Begin by importing the `random` package. Then use the `random()` function from that package to generate a (pseudo)random `float` in the interval `[0,1)`. For example:

```python
import random

def main():
    print(random.random())

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
gives the following possible output (of course when you run it, a different number will be generated, since the number produced is random).

```
0.9654798677156062
```

A note about `import`: it is possible to import just a single function from a package rather than the entire package. If you do this, then you can refer to the function by its name `function_name`, rather than `package_name.function_name`. The following code is functionally identical to the example above:

```python
from random import random

def main():
    print(random())

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Generating `float` values within an interval

Use the `random.uniform()` function if you want a random `float` from the interval different than `[0,1)`. For example,

```python
import random

def main():
    print(random.uniform(2, 5))

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
outputs a random decimal number in the range `[2, 5)`, such as
```
2.7178618144891766
```

## Generating random `int` values within a range

One way to generate random integer values is to use the `randint()` function from the `random` package. The parameters are the lower bound and the upper bound you want for the integers. Unlike other functions in python, the stop value **is** included in the possible outcomes. For example:

```python
print(random.randint(2, 5))
```
will output one of `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`.

## An alternate method for generating random numbers within a range

You can use `random.random()` to generate a random `float` in the range `[0,1)`, then multiply by a number to scale it. For example, the expression `10*random.random()` will generate a random `float` in the range `[0, 10)`. You can then shift the interval by adding a number. For example, the expression `2 + 10 * random.random()` generates a random `float` in the range `[2, 12)`. 

More generally, the number that is added represents the left edge of the interval, while the scaling factor represents the length of the interval. To generates a random `float` in the range `[a, b)`, you can use the expression `a + (b - a) * random.random()`.

To generate a random `int` value in a specific range, we use the same multiplication and addition technique, followed by casting the result to an integer. For example, `int(5 * random.random())` generates a random integer `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` or `4`. Notice that before casting, `5 * random.random()` generates a number in the range `[0, 5)`. Since `5` is not included in the interval, when we cast to an `int`, it will not be one of the possible outcomes.  As another example, to generate a random `int` from the integers `6, 7, 8, 9`, Note that there are 4 possibilities, beginning with `6`. So we can generate random `int`s in that range with the expression `int(6 + 4 * random.random())`

More generally, the expression `int(a + n * random.random())` will generate a random `int` in a range of `n` possible integer outputs, starting with `a`.


## Putting it all together

The example below creates a `400x400` pixel `dudraw` canvas, with the default `[0, 1]x[0, 1]` scale. It then draws a circle at a random location with a radius from `0.05` to `0.1` and with a random color. A possible output image is shown.

```python
import random
import dudraw


def main():
    # Set up the canvas, 400x400 pixels
    dudraw.set_canvas_size(400,400)
    # Background light gray
    dudraw.clear(dudraw.LIGHT_GRAY)
    # Pick two random values from the interval [0,1]
    # for the center of the circle.
    x_center = random.random()
    y_center = random.random()
    # Random from 0.05 up to 0.1 for the radius
    radius = random.uniform(0.05, 0.1)
    # three values from 0-255 (inclusive) for the rgb color
    red = random.randint(0,255)
    green = random.randint(0,255)
    blue = random.randint(0,255)
    # Set pen color then draw the circle
    dudraw.set_pen_color_rgb(red, green, blue)
    dudraw.filled_circle(x_center, y_center, radius)
    # Display the result for 10 seconds
    dudraw.show(10000)

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
